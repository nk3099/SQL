-- group by origin, destination

--case2: if there are OneWayTrip ('O') and RoundTrip ('R'):
--note: if BOM->DEL then round trip would be DEL->BOM (and not BOM->DEL itself, so 2*ticket_count is wrong)
--ie, for Round trip (origin,destination) would become (destination,origin) and we then calculate ticket_count again for roundtrip
