--NOTE:
/*SQL Server doesnâ€™t have direct support 
for regular expressions like some other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL)*

In SQL Server (MSSQL), there isn't full support for POSIX regular expressions like in PostgreSQL. 
However, SQL Server does provide some basic pattern matching functionality 
through LIKE, PATINDEX, and CHARINDEX. These are limited in comparison to 
the full power of regular expressions, but they can handle many common use cases 
for pattern matching.

--A column contains list of phone numbers as keyed in by users. 
--You are supposed to find only those phone numbers which don't have any repeating numbers, 
--ie. all numbers of the phone number must be unique
--Also, pls ignore the starting extension part of phone

create table phone_numbers (num varchar(20));
insert into phone_numbers values
