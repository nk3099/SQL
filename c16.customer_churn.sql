group by month(last_month.order_date) --as need monthwise data

--Note: In Churn, the last_month data doesn't have any value, only next_month will hold value to identify Churn.
--Therefore, last_month table would be driving table for Churn query as (customers who ordered last_month but not this_month)

--Also can do "month(last_month.order_date)+1 as month_name" if to say its in Feb(2nd month) Churn
--But again, same thing - instead we saying as Jan(1st month). Lastly, no data for March(3rd month) so all churn.

--OR--
--using LEAD function--

select month(order_date) as month_name, sum(case when month(order_date)-month(lastdate)=0 then 1 else 0 end) as retained_customers
